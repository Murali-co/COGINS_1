Candidate's Current Skills: {skills_str}

Please analyze the skill gap and return a JSON object with the following fields:
1. "present_skills": list of skills the candidate already possesses that are highly relevant to the target role.
2. "missing_skills": list of critical skills/technologies/methodologies required for the target role that the candidate currently lacks.
3. "skill_score": an integer from 0 to 100 representing how closely the candidate's current skills match the target role.
4. "recommendations": bullet points suggesting how the candidate can bridge the skill gap (e.g. projects, certifications).
5. "learning_resources": high-quality resource suggestions (e.g., online courses, books, documentation links).

Example response format:
{{
  "present_skills": ["Python", "Docker"],
  "missing_skills": ["Kubernetes", "Go"],
  "skill_score": 65,
  "recommendations": ["Build a multi-container app and deploy to Kubernetes.", "Learn Go syntax and build a REST API."],
  "learning_resources": ["Official Kubernetes Documentation (kubernetes.io)", "Learn Go on tour.golang.org"]
}}

Return ONLY valid JSON.
